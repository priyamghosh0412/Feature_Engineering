# Feature Engineering
## Introduction
What is a feature and why we need the engineering of it? Basically, all machine learning algorithms use some input data to create outputs. This input data comprise features, which are usually in the form of structured columns. Algorithms require features with some specific characteristic to work properly. Here, the need for feature engineering arises. I think feature engineering efforts mainly have two goals:
* Preparing the proper input dataset, compatible with the machine learning algorithm requirements.
* Improving the performance of machine learning models.
